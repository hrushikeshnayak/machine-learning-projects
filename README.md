    <h1>Welcome to My Machine Learning Projects Repository</h1>

    <p>This repository contains a collection of machine learning projects and experiments that I've worked on. The projects cover various topics and techniques, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), OpenCV, YOLO, scikit-learn, and more. While specific project names are not mentioned here for brevity, you'll find a diverse range of ML-related content within this repository.</p>

    <p>Additionally, I will be continuously adding new projects to this repository in the future, so make sure to check back for updates and new machine learning experiments.</p>
