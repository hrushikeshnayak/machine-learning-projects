# Machine Learning Projects Repository

## Welcome to My Machine Learning Projects Repository

This repository contains a collection of machine learning projects and experiments that I've worked on. The projects cover various topics and techniques, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), OpenCV, YOLO, scikit-learn, and more. While specific project names are not mentioned here for brevity, you'll find a diverse range of ML-related content within this repository.

Additionally, I will be continuously adding new projects to this repository in the future, so make sure to check back for updates and new machine learning experiments.
