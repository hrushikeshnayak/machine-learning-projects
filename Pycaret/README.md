# PyCaret Implementation with Flood Dataset

This repository contains the implementation of PyCaret with the Flood dataset, which consists of various DDoS (Distributed Denial-of-Service) attacks. DDoS attacks are malicious attempts to disrupt the normal traffic of a targeted server, service, or network by overwhelming it with a flood of Internet traffic. The dataset includes the following common types of DDoS attacks:

- TCP Flood Attack
- UDP Flood Attack
- ICMP (Ping) Flood Attack

These attacks represent some of the most common threats that are increasing in sophistication and frequency.

## Dataset

The Flood dataset used in this implementation contains instances of TCP Flood, UDP Flood, and ICMP Flood attacks.


## Documentation

For more information on PyCaret and its functionalities, refer to the [PyCaret documentation](https://pycaret.gitbook.io/docs/get-started/quickstart).
