# Traffic Image Object Detection using YOLO

## Overview
This project implements object detection on traffic images using YOLO (You Only Look Once), a state-of-the-art real-time object detection system. YOLO is known for its speed and accuracy, making it suitable for various applications, including traffic monitoring and management.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- YOLOv8 pre-trained weights and configuration files
- Traffic image dataset (not included, you may use publicly available datasets or collect your own)
