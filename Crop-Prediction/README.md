# Crop Prediction Machine Learning Project

## Overview

This repository contains the code for an end-to-end machine learning project focused on predicting suitable crops based on soil parameters. The project involves the use of multiple machine learning algorithms and the implementation of a Django web application with a user-friendly frontend.


- **`Form Section :
Input Form for Soil Parameters
The above screenshot showcases the input form section of the web application. Users can conveniently input soil parameters, such as pH level, nutrient content, and moisture, to generate predictions for the most suitable crops.`**
